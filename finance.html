            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Hello! My name is Anjali Artz, I am a high schooler who is very passionate and focused on learning all there is to know about financial literacy and investing. While educating myslef about various financial topics, I love teaching my community aswell! Finance, specifically personal finance is something everyone should we educated on. We all use it in our daily life, and it is something that will continue to show up throughout all of our lives.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                My journey to learning about financial education started when my dad first taught me about the stock market. We both sat in front of his work laptop, and studied how the stock prices would one day be up $30 and the next down $150. I was so confused and curious at thr same time at how people could just lose and then regain so mch money in such a short amount of time. I've continued learning about personal finance ever since, and it created such a strong bond between my dad and I.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For my passion project, I wanted to teach many kids about finance, and how important it is. It is an important skill that many kids are not well educated on. I created a 20+ slideshow to showcase my understanding of financy, specificallly the stock market and investing. In addition to strenghtening my own personal knowledge, I wanted to educate my close friends and family about the topics I've been studying for as long as I can remember.

I wanted the slideshow to be interactive, with many activites and Q&A sections, tending to each induvidual students needs. Topics covered included:

                       To find out how effective this course actually was, I set up diagnostic tests, testing my sutdents knowledge before and after the course. This is to track each induvidual students progress, and see what certain areas they do or do not need imporovement with. The results included:

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This project not only taught my students about finance and how they are the next generation to be investing, but it also taught me a lot by myself. While embraking on a journey and many weeks of being called "Ms. Artz", this has really shown how I am a good teacher and lsitener. Before starting this passion project, I never considered myself a "pro" at teaching things, and I always thought my descriptions of certain things made people more confused. While teaching, I realized how passionate I was and how happy I was to see my personal progress, but mainly how much my students have learned and grown.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
               Seeing my students so passionate about learning new things, really inspired me. Everytime one of my students used their new knowledge to explain the things around them, a smile slowly began to show on my face.
